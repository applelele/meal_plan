# How do we load the file in lib/meal_plan.rb?
# require_relative
# require
  # - It seems to look at directories that are in your $LOAD_PATH

# load
# $LOAD_PATH << "/Users/applelele1/loading_files_ruby/lib"

# require does not work with relative paths because your current directory is not in your $LOAD_PATH

# require "../lib/meal_plan" - because one, bin/meal_plan, so it should ../lib/meal_plan - this is still re;ative
# require "/Users/applelele1/loading_files_ruby/lib/meal_plan"
# require "./lib/meal_plan" . the current directory

# Rule of Thumb
# Don't alter $LOAD_PATH
# Use require to load gems only!
